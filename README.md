## Custom Terminal Project in C Language

###Introduction
THE MYSH PROJECT INVOLVES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CUSTOM TERMINAL
SHELL WRITTEN IN C. THE GOAL IS TO CREATE A LIGHTWEIGHT AND SIMPLE
TERMINAL THAT SIMULATES THE BEHAVIOR OF COMMON UNIX/LINUX
SHELLS. THE TERMINAL SUPPORTS EXECUTING EXTERNAL COMMANDS,
BUILT-IN COMMANDS LIKE CD AND EXIT, INPUT/OUTPUT REDIRECTION, AND
PIPING. IT IS A FOUNDATIONAL TOOL FOR LEARNING ABOUT PROCESS
CONTROL, SYSTEM CALLS, AND BASIC SHELL FUNCTIONALITIES IN
OPERATING SYSTEMS.
###Features
THE CUSTOM TERMINAL, MYSH, IMPLEMENTS SEVERAL FEATURES TYPICAL OF A
LINUX SHELL. THE FUNCTIONALITIES INCLUDE:
BUILT-IN COMMANDS:
EXIT: EXITS THE SHELL PROGRAM, TERMINATING THE USER SESSION.
CD <DIRECTORY>: CHANGES THE CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY TO THE
SPECIFIED DIRECTORY. THIS COMMAND MIMICS THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE CD
COMMAND IN BASH.
EXTERNAL COMMAND EXECUTION
THE SHELL SUPPORTS RUNNING ANY EXTERNAL COMMAND AVAILABLE IN THE
SYSTEM'S PATH, SUCH AS LS, PWD, CAT, AND MORE. THESE COMMANDS ARE
EXECUTED IN CHILD PROCESSES CREATED BY FORK(), AND THEIR OUTPUT IS
DISPLAYED IN THE TERMINAL.
INPUT AND OUTPUT REDIRECTION
OUTPUT REDIRECTION (>): THE SHELL ALLOWS THE OUTPUT OF A COMMAND TO
BE REDIRECTED INTO A FILE, OVERWRITING THE EXISTING FILE IF IT EXISTS.
INPUT REDIRECTION (<): THE SHELL ALSO ALLOWS READING FROM A FILE TO
PROVIDE INPUT TO COMMANDS.
PIPING
THE SHELL SUPPORTS PIPING, WHERE THE OUTPUT OF ONE COMMAND IS USED
AS THE INPUT FOR THE NEXT. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY CONNECTING COMMANDS
THROUGH PIPES (|).
PROCESS MANAGEMENT
THE TERMINAL ALLOWS COMMANDS TO BE EXECUTED IN THE BACKGROUND
USING &. THIS PREVENTS THE TERMINAL FROM WAITING FOR THE PROCESS TO
FINISH BEFORE ACCEPTING NEW COMMANDS
